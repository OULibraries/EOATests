This subdirectory captures a workflow I'm using for right now.  That doesn't mean it has to be the way we end up doing things.

Copy this .../tex/ directory into your .../eos_vagrant/ checkout after following the instructions from the latter's README.
Then, you can run .../eos_vagrant/tex/vagrant.sh as root from within the VM, and it should run the twocol.tex publication through the whole pipeline to create the Django output.
